Machine Learning Resources

This repository contains a collection of resources related to machine learning, including tutorials, courses, books, datasets, and libraries.

Datasets

    UCI Machine Learning Repository - A collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the  
    empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.
          
    Kaggle Datasets - A platform for data science competitions that also hosts a large collection of datasets.

    Google Dataset Search - A search engine for datasets, developed by Google.


Libraries

    Scikit-Learn - A Python library for machine learning built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
    
    Numpy -  Array creation: NumPy provides functions for creating arrays of different shapes and sizes, including arrays filled with zeros, ones, constant values, and  arrays created from existing data.   
    Array operations: NumPy supports a variety of array operations, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex operations such as matrix multiplication and element-wise functions like exponential and logarithm.
    
    Matplotlib - pyplot is a module in the matplotlib library, which provides a convenient interface for plotting data in Python. pyplot provides functions for creating a variety of different types of plots, including line plots, scatter plots, bar plots, histograms, and more. Additionally, pyplot includes a number of functions for customizing plots, such as adding titles, labels, and legends, adjusting axis limits and scales, and controlling the appearance of lines, markers, and other elements.
    
    Pandas - pandas is a library in Python used for data analysis and manipulation.
     Data import and export: pandas provides functions for reading and writing data from a variety of different file formats, including CSV, Excel, JSON, and SQL databases.
     Data cleaning and transformation: pandas provides a rich set of functions for cleaning and transforming data, such as removing duplicates, handling missing values, and transforming data using operations such as grouping and pivoting.
     Data aggregation and summarization: pandas provides functions for aggregating and summarizing data, such as computing means, medians, and other summary statistics.
     Data visualization: pandas integrates well with the matplotlib library, providing functions for creating a variety of different types of plots and charts, such as line plots, bar plots, histograms, and scatter plots.
