Machine Learning Resources

This repository contains a collection of resources related to machine learning, including tutorials, courses, books, datasets, and libraries.

Datasets

    UCI Machine Learning Repository - A collection of databases, domain theories, and data generators that are used by the machine learning community for the  
    empirical analysis of machine learning algorithms.
          
    Kaggle Datasets - A platform for data science competitions that also hosts a large collection of datasets.

    Google Dataset Search - A search engine for datasets, developed by Google.


Libraries

    Scikit-Learn - A Python library for machine learning built on top of NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib.
    Numpy -  Array creation: NumPy provides functions for creating arrays of different shapes and sizes, including arrays filled with zeros, ones, constant values, and  arrays created from existing data.   
    Array operations: NumPy supports a variety of array operations, such as element-wise addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, as well as more complex operations such as matrix multiplication and element-wise functions like exponential and logarithm.
